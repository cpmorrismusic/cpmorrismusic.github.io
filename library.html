                <h4>Impressions of Detroit</h4>
                <br />
                <p>Impressions of Detroit was originally written in 1989, while the composer lived in the city, it was revised in 2010. Even in decline, Detroit is the definition of “solidly built.” Many of the massive structures were built in the 1920s
                    and 1930’s, such as the train station, the library, and the Detroit Institute of Art. The huge rotting Ford factories in Highland Park, as well as the empty downtown department stores, bank buildings and Tiger Stadium (demolished in
                    2009) in CorkTown have many untold stories of thousands of people. And juxtaposed against all this is the massive steaming River Rouge Ford automobile plant.</p>
                <br />
                <p>The composer tried to describe musically some of the power of this past great city. It is a poignant moment to witness the results of previous people's hopes and dreams and tragic, at the same time, as one gazes at such past immense wealth,
                    power and beauty. It is probably a sense akin to the original discoveries of the pyramid’s contents, or an ancient civilization site- if one takes a moment to observe and absorb.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p><strong>Movement 1:</strong> “The Summit” is one of the largest buildings of downtown Detroit. It lies at the river’s edge and from the top of the building one can see all Detroit, which is modeled after Paris, with large boulevards flowing
                    out like sun rays. The majesty of this building was originally as a hotel, but now is home to General Motors.</p>
                <br />
                <p><strong>Movement 2:</strong> “The Corridor” is a vision of Cass Corridor which has declined over the years. Once it boasted restaurants, jazz clubs and the like. Recently it is a subculture area upon which Wayne State University borders.
                    As one wanders down this street, one imagines ghosts of earlier, happy times, as well as tragedies.</p>
                <br />
                <p><strong>Movement 3:</strong> “The Bridge” is a musical description of the Ambassador Bridge which connects Detroit with Windsor, Canada. The bridge is a spanned bridge, which is majestic and a tribute to the cooperation between the United
                    States and Canada. When crossing from Canada, the bridge rises above the city, seemingly aloof to what lies below, but quickly brings the traveler into the harsh reality which is the physical remains of a once Great City.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p><em>Impressions of Detroit</em> is dedicated to the composer’s father, who worked as a church organist his entire life.</p>
